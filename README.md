## Learnings- React + Vite – A powerful combo for building fast, modern web applications.
- Firebase SDK & API keys – Learned that keys in the frontend are not a security hole by themselves, as Firebase relies on security rules and authentication for protection.
- Security rules matter – Proper Firestore rules are essential to ensure only authorized users can read/write data.
- Vite’s build process – Super fast, but makes it easy to inspect your bundle — a reminder to always review production builds.
- TailwindCSS – Once you get the hang of utility classes, styling becomes quick and consistent.
- React + Firebase – A smooth combo for small-to-medium apps, especially when prototyping quickly.\
